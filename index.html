    <p>This is the best Chicken Soup Recipe to make when you’re craving simple comfort food or feeling under the
        weather. Made with bone-in chicken thighs simmered into a flavorful broth and filled with tender onions,
        carrots, celery, and juicy shredded chicken.</p>

    <p>This classic chicken soup is my all-time favorite soup recipe. Much like my homemade chicken noodle soup recipe,
        this noodle-free version is wholesome, delicious, and filled with zero processed carbohydrates. Whether you make
        your own broth or purchase pre-made, this wintertime staple is perfect for chilly nights, sore throats, good
        days, and bad days.</p>

    <p>It’s also my family’s favorite.</p>

    <p>Filled with onions, carrots, and celery, feel free to add all your favorite vegetables including leeks, cucumber,
        parsnips, potatoes, and kale</p>

    <h2 id="second">Chicken Soup Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Chicken:</b> I have prepared this soup using chicken breasts, bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, boneless
                skinless chicken thighs, a combination of each, and every other combination you can imagine. While there
                is no “wrong” chicken for chicken soup, if you plan to prepare your own “quick” broth as I explain in
                this recipe (different from chicken stock or bone broth), I find that skinless bone-in chicken thighs
                are the best. The broth is flavorful, but not overly fatty and the chicken remains juicy – unlike
                chicken breasts which are prone to drying out from prolonged boiling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Broth:</b> Prepare your own or use your favorite store-bought broth. For this recipe, I simply
                simmered chicken thighs in water to make the broth base. For heartier broth recipes, check out my
                chicken stock or beef bone broth recipe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Vegetables:</b> Nearly every country has its own version of chicken soup. As such, each version will
                look and taste a little different from the next. The most common vegetables, however, include a mixture
                of onion, celery, and carrots (also known as the mirepoix).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Herbs:</b> Keep it simple or go wild, the herbs you choose to flavor your soup are entirely up to you.
                In this version, I left things super simple and only added a touch of fresh chopped parsley after the
                soup was finished cooking. Other popular herbs, dried or fresh, include oregano, rosemary, and thyme.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Optional:</b> Try adding some anti-inflammatory ingredients including garlic, ginger, and turmeric. If
                you’re new to cooking with any of these ingredients, start with a small amount and add more as needed.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="third">How to Make Chicken Soup:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make your broth:</b> Since we’re not making chicken stock, this should only take about 30-45 minutes at
            the most. Simply add the raw chicken thighs to a large stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil.
            Reduce to medium-low heat and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. If you’re short on time, skip this
            step and use your favorite store-bought chicken stock and add shredded rotisserie chicken.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Cook the vegetables (mirepoix):</b> While you wait for your chicken to finish cooking, cook the
            vegetables in a separate pot or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Cook the vegetables for 10-15 minutes or
            until they start to soften. Toward the end, add the salt, black pepper, bay leaves, and garlic (if using).
        </li>
        <br />
        <center><img src="./images/p4.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="375px"></center>
        <br />
        <li><b>Strain the broth:</b> Once the chicken is fully cooked, carefully remove the chicken from the pot and
            strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into the same pot containing the vegetables.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Shred the chicken:</b> Once it is cool enough to handle. Do not return the chicken to the pot.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Simmer & serve:</b> Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are fully cooked and tender. In the
            last 10 minutes, add the shredded chicken and lemon juice and season to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="fourth">How to Freeze Leftover Chicken Soup:</h2>

    <p><b>To freeze, allow your soup to cool at room temperature before transferring to the refrigerator to cool
            completely.</b> Next, transfer to freezer-friendly containers or double-bag in freezer-friendly zip-lock
        bags. Remove most of the air, leaving just a small amount of space to allow the liquid to expand as it freezes.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>To reheat</b>, allow the soup to thaw in the fridge overnight, then transfer to a pot and cook until
            heated through.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Keep frozen for up to 6-8 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But what about if you don’t plan to freeze the leftovers? <b>Enjoy within 5 days</b>, thoroughly reheating each
        time.</p>

    <h2 id="fivth">How do You Add Flavor to Chicken Soup?</h2>

    <p>For the best possible flavor, make your own stock or chicken broth using fresh ingredients – ditch the bouillon
        cubes (most contain MSG). Brown your chicken pieces and add chicken bones, vegetable scraps, a few garlic
        cloves, and toss in some fresh herbs (fresh dill, fresh thyme, fresh parsley) to the simmering broth.</p>
